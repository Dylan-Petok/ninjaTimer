# ninjaTimer
A fun mini game designed to test your reaction speed!
All code is located in master branch.

This projects inspiration was pulled from wanting to learn how to use the Vue.js, single page application framework. I started by creating a small project. 

Within this project I learned how to create components and how to use them within an application. I learned the use of templates and how to re-use code efficiently with Vue. 

I used the v-if clause many times within script tags to display components based on certain conditions. Furthermore, I learned where to write my methods and store data for specific components to make code easier to read and edit/update.
